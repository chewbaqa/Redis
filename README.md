# Redis

### Redis is an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, message broken and streaming engine.

_In this project I built my own Redis server that is capable of serving basic command `PING` for concurrent clients. Implemented with the help of socket and threading packages in Python. Built by the basic knowledge acquired in my Computer Networks classes. Doesn't include a redis parser, output is hardcoded. Will implement more basic commands in the future._
